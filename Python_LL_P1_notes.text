PYTHON LEARNING LANGUAGE
#PART I - PYTHON LEARNING LANGUAGE
  #PYTHON HOME & #PYTHON INTRO
    Python - is a high level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language
      # - abtracts away many low level hardware details
      # - interpreted - source code executed by interpreter for quick edit-test cycle
      # - general purpose - (not limited to one domain: web/scientific), many different programming tasks.
        #Python Language Uses:
          # - WEB DEVELOPMENT - back-end services, APIs
          # - DATA ANALYSIS, MACHINE LEARNING & SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING 
          # - AUTOMATION AND SCRIPTING (Tasks like File Processing, DevOps)
          # - PROTOTYPING AND RAPID APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 
          # - EDUCATIONAL CONTEXTS (BEGINNER-FRIENDLY)
          # - WINDOWS/MAC/LINUX/RASPBERRY PI
          
  #PYTHON GET STARTED
      Python Editor - software application used to wrtie, edit, and manage Python code
        #Check the Python Version of the editor:
          ```
          import sys
          print(sys.version)
          ```
      Python Command Line - text based interface used to interact with a computer's operating system to run Python scripts and pass arguments to programs.
        #When done with interface
        ```
        exit()
        ```
        
  #PYTHON SYNTAX
      #Syntax - refers to the set of rules that define how code must be structured and organized so that the Python interpreter can understand and execute it correctly. 
        #Indentation - refers to the spaces at the begginning line of code.
        #Python Variables - symbolic names that refer to objects or values stored in memory, acting as containers for data that can be referenced and manipulated during program execution.
        #Comment - lines of text within the source code that are ignored by the Python Interpreter during execution.
        #Statement - complete instruction that tells the interpreter to perform a specfic action, serving as the smallest executable unit of code
